## Description
My code assignments/examples/ipythons for every lesson of all courses of the Machine Learning Specialization Coursera

## Course 1 - Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
### Learning outcomes
- Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
- Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
- Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
- Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
- Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
- Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
- Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
- Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
- Implement these techniques in Python.

## Course 2 - Machine Learning: Regression
### Lessons
1. Simple linear regression
2. Multiple regression
3. Assessing performance
4. Ridge regression
5. Feature selection & Lasso
6. Nearest neighbor & kernel regression

### Learning outcomes
- Describe the input and output of a regression model.
- Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
- Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
- Tune parameters with cross validation.
- Analyze the performance of the model.
- Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
- Deploy methods to select between models.
- Exploit the model to form predictions.
